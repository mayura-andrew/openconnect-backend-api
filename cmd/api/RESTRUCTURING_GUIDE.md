# API Restructuring - New Folder Structure

## Overview
This document outlines the restructured Go REST API following Go best practices for better organization, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

## New Structure

```
cmd/api/
├── main_new.go          # New entry point (replace main.go)
├── app/                 # Application core
│   ├── application.go   # Application struct and dependencies
│   ├── context.go       # Context helper functions
│   ├── errors.go        # Error response handlers
│   └── helpers.go       # Helper functions (JSON, file processing)
├── config/              # Configuration management
│   └── config.go        # Configuration struct and parsing
├── handlers/            # HTTP handlers organized by domain
│   ├── healthcheck.go   # Health check handler
│   └── handlers.go      # Placeholder handlers (to be moved from original files)
├── middleware/          # HTTP middleware
│   └── middleware.go    # Authentication, CORS, rate limiting, etc.
├── routes/              # Route definitions
│   └── routes.go        # All route configurations
└── server/              # Server management
    └── server.go        # HTTP server setup and graceful shutdown
```

## Benefits of New Structure

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Each package has a single responsibility
- Configuration is isolated from business logic
- Middleware is separate from handlers
- Routes are centralized and easy to manage

### 2. **Better Maintainability**
- Code is organized by function rather than being in one large package
- Easy to locate specific functionality
- Reduced coupling between components

### 3. **Improved Testability**
- Each package can be tested independently
- Dependencies are clearly defined
- Mock interfaces can be easily created

### 4. **Scalability**
- Easy to add new handlers, middleware, or configuration options
- Clear patterns for extension
- Better code reusability

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Core Structure (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created new folder structure
- ✅ Moved configuration to `config/` package
- ✅ Created `app/` package with Application struct
- ✅ Moved helper functions to `app/helpers.go`
- ✅ Moved error handlers to `app/errors.go`
- ✅ Moved context functions to `app/context.go`
- ✅ Created middleware package with proper function signatures
- ✅ Created routes package with centralized route definitions
- ✅ Created server package with graceful shutdown
- ✅ Created new main.go entry point

### Phase 2: Handler Migration (NEXT STEPS)
- [ ] Move ideas handlers from `ideas.go` to `handlers/ideas.go`
- [ ] Move user handlers from `users.go` to `handlers/users.go`
- [ ] Move auth handlers from `tokens.go` to `handlers/auth.go`
- [ ] Move OAuth handlers from `oauth.go` to `handlers/oauth.go`
- [ ] Move profile handlers from `user_profiles.go` to `handlers/user_profiles.go`
- [ ] Move file handlers from `files.go` to `handlers/files.go`

### Phase 3: Testing and Cleanup
- [ ] Test all endpoints with new structure
- [ ] Remove old files after verification
- [ ] Update any import paths in other parts of the application
- [ ] Add unit tests for each package

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Configuration
- Moved from `main.go` to dedicated `config/config.go`
- Cleaner struct field names (uppercase for exported fields)
- Centralized configuration loading

### 2. Application Structure
- Application struct moved to `app/application.go`
- All application methods are now exported (TitleCase)
- Clear dependency injection pattern

### 3. Middleware
- Converted from methods to functions returning middleware
- Better composition and reusability
- Type-safe middleware chaining

### 4. Routes
- Centralized route definitions
- Clear middleware application
- Easy to understand request flow

### 5. Error Handling
- Consistent error response patterns
- Exported functions for reusability
- Better separation of concerns

## Usage Example

The new structure allows for clean initialization:

```go
func main() {
    // Load configuration
    cfg, err := config.LoadConfig()
    
    // Initialize application
    app := &app.Application{
        Config: cfg,
        // ... other dependencies
    }
    
    // Start server with all middleware and routes
    server.Serve(app)
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Migrate Original Handlers**: Move all handler functions from the original files to the new `handlers/` package
2. **Update Import Paths**: Ensure all imports point to the new structure
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify all endpoints work correctly
4. **Remove Old Files**: Clean up the original files once migration is complete
5. **Add Documentation**: Document each package and its responsibilities

This restructuring provides a solid foundation for a scalable, maintainable Go REST API following industry best practices.
